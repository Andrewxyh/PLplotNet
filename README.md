# PLplot bindings for .NET
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/byma2lmdgl54m3h9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/surban/plplotnet)

[PLplot](http://plplot.sourceforge.net/)  is a cross-platform software package for creating scientific plots whose (UTF-8) plot symbols and text are limited in practice only by what Unicode-aware system fonts are installed on a user's computer.

The PLplot core library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page, and multiple pages are allowed for those device formats that support them.

Output File Formats: PDF, PNG, JPEG, PostScript
